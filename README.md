2. Open terminal and go to the project folder.
3. Type ``` sudo make install ``` to finish installing the tool.
### Installation Check

## Uninstallation
1. Open terminal and go to the project folder.
2. Type ``` sudo make uninstall ``` to remove the tool from your computer.

## Emptiness Checking
Type  ``` foada -e [inputfile] ``` to check whether the automaton in the inputfile is empty. The implemented algorithms is IMPACT.
